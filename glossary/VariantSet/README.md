  A VariantSet is a composition arc that allows a content creator to package a discrete set of alternatives, between which a downstream consumer is able to non-destructively switch, or augment.  A reasonable way to think about VariantSets is as a "switchable reference".  Each Variant of a VariantSet encapsulates a tree of scene description that will be composed onto the prim on which the VariantSet is defined, when the Variant is selected.
